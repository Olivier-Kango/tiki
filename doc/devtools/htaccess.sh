# This script renames _htaccess files to .htaccess 
# http://doc.tiki.org/Clean+URLs
# 
# This script was more useful before, because there were many files to rename. More recently, Tiki 
# ships with already named .htaccess files in all subdirectories. Thus, only one file needs to be 
# renamed, the one at the root directory.
#
# You can simply rename _htaccess to .htaccess in your root directory, instead of using this script.
# Nonetheless, the script can be useful if you want to put in a cron job.
# For example, along with doc/devtools/svnup.sh
#
# usage:
# sh doc/devtools/htaccess.sh
#
