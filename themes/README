TIKI THEMES

Few basic themes, such as the default themes, are distributed with Tiki but you'll find more available and you can
create or adapt an existing theme (respect licencing instructions) for your own purpose. The default themes are here
to help you to start with your Tiki and to understand how this work in Tiki.

To add a new theme or to move a themes from a Tiki to another just drop your theme folder into the themes folder (the
folder containing this file). This folder contain sub-folder so everything part of your design has its place and things
stay clean.

FOR DEVELOPPERS

If you are a developper or a designer, you can create easily a Tiki theme.

Most of the folders that are in your theme are not mandatory. While you have many folders, you don't have to use them
all. For example, you can the use  the "fonts" folders to store your theme fonts internally or use external fonts or
use the default fonts from the browser.

You can refer to the default theme (themes/default/) and the fivealive theme (theme/fivealive/) folders to see samples
of the possible folders and how to organise properly the content of your theme.

Some folders contain files that can be edited manually and that are or can be auto-generated using less (Tiki18 and
before) or sass/scss (from Tiki19).

Each folder's name is crealy informative:
* css: that must contain the theme .css files (manually editable or auto-generated)
* favicons: where you can place your theme customs favicons (check the Tiki favicon feature)
* fonts: where you can place your theme customs fonts
* icons: where you can place your theme customs icons
* images: where you can place your theme images (logo, backgrouns, etc)
* jquery-ui: where you can place your theme jquery additional scripts
* js: where you can place your theme additional javascript
* less: where you can place your theme less files to be compiled to create your css file (Tiki18 and before)
* options: where you can place different flavours for a theme (check the fivealive theme for better understanding)
* scss: where you can place your theme scss files to be compiled to create your css file (from Tiki19)
* templates: where you can place your theme custom templates files
