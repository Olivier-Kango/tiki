Tiki has favicon support for modern Apple, Android & Windows integration.

To use custom favicons on your website create favicons with the same dimensions and filenames as the
favicons found in themes/base_files/favicons

Placing favicon-16x16.png in your themes favicon directory will trigger tiki to look for the rest of the
favicons in your customized folder. You must use favicon-16x16.png, but may choose not to use the remaining
favicons. When favicon-16x16.png is used, none of the default tiki icons will be displayed.

To generate all the favicons and the supporting xml & jason files, visit http://realfavicongenerator.net.

To disable this functionality, enable the tiki preference in "Look and Feel -> Miscellaneous -> Disable Favicons"
