# themes/js/

If there is a custom.js file here, it will be included, in addition to, but before any custom.js present in the current theme.

SO this is very UNLIKE the behaviour of [lib/templates/](../templates/README.md) which overrides the themes.

No versionned files should be present here, so any user files survives upgrades.
