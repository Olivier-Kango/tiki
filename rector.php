/*

To run rector (https://getrector.com/documentation) on a file or directory, run:

php bin/rector process --memory-limit=4G --dry-run

Obviously, always run --dry-run first.

Normally, you should commit changes to this file only if you apply a rector globally.

Since rector deprecated setlists, you should commit "One shot" sets with the last one applied, commented out, such as:
SymfonySetList::SYMFONY_64 //Applied from SYMFONY_60 to SYMFONY_64 2024-02-17

Recurrent (code quality sets) should be committed uncommented once applied.  Eventually, the CI will run this file and error out if there would be changes.

If you apply something with rector, you commits should be something like:

For global commits (in this case the changes to rector.php would be commited):

[REF] Rector:  Update rules to apply SymfonyLevelSetList::UP_TO_SYMFONY_54 globally

One shot, or partial application (in which case your changes in rector.php should not be commited, or commited commented-out):

[REF] Rector:  Apply ReturnTypeFromStrictNativeCallRector::class to path lib/core
