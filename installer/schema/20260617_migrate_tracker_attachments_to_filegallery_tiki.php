/**
 * The tracker "Attachments" tab (useAttachments option) and the deprecated Attachment
 * (type A) tracker field have both been removed, so nothing can write new rows into
 * tiki_tracker_item_attachments anymore. Any row still there is leftover data from one
 * of those two removed features and would be silently lost, so this patch stays pending
 * until it has been migrated to a "Files" tracker field with the existing
 * console.php tracker:convert-attachments command.
 *
 * The failure is deferred: later patches still run (some of them are required before that
 * console command can start), the message is shown, and this patch is tried again on the
 * next database update. It is not recorded in tiki_schema while it is pending.
 *
 * Attachments left behind by tracker items that no longer exist can't be migrated (there
 * is no item left to attach a file to), so those are removed automatically before the check.
 *
 * Once no attachment data remains, also leave the patch pending when an Attachment (type A)
 * field definition is still present: nothing removes those automatically, and they are dead
 * weight that should be removed from their tracker before this patch completes.
 *
 * @param Installer $installer
 * @return bool
 * @throws DeferredPatchException When attachment data or deprecated fields still need attention
