# Tiki Help: 
# The config in this file is meant mostly for manual usage:
#
# php vendor_bundled/vendor/phpstan/phpstan/phpstan
#
# But as of 2023-11-20, this still returns over 600 errors
#
# When reviewing an entire file, you'll usually want a higher level of check (probably 3), which is:
# php vendor_bundled/vendor/phpstan/phpstan/phpstan analyse --level=3  ./lib/tikilib.php
# You can also do this for directories: 
# php vendor_bundled/vendor/phpstan/phpstan/phpstan analyse --level=3  ./lib/core/Tracker/

# The ultimate goal is to define our own custom rules for the worst problems and integrate this to the CI process
