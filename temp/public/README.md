# temp/public/

DEPRECATED For temp files that need to be http readable by the end user's browser.  Will all move to public/temp

What's here:

* temp/public/codemirror.*
  * Used for syntax highlighting code blocks
* temp/public/vue_*
  * Files compiled from lib/vue/rules/*.vue (UIPredicate), and moved here to be referenced by the html.  Should disapear once we move UIPredicate to Vue3.
