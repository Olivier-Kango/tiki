These are NOT unit tests (which are found in lib/test/*), it is the code of the TikiTest tiki feature, which allows recording, replaying and comparing tiki browsing sessions.  It is documented at https://dev.tiki.org/TikiTests and https://doc.tiki.org/TikiTests.

This directory is in the root directory because it needs to be directly routed to, just like thet tiki-*.php files.  It will move to an eventual routes directory along with them whenever that happens.

As of 2023-03-28, this code hasn't seen code changes (other than styling and paths) in over a decade.
