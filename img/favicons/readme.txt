Tiki has favicon support for modern Apple, Android & Windows integration.

To use custom favicons on your website create favicons with the same demensions and filenames as the
favicons found in themes/base_files/favicons

To generate these favicons and the supporting xml & jason files, visit http://realfavicongenerator.net.

To disable the feature, enable the tiki preference in "Look and Feel -> Miscellaneous -> Disable Favicons"
