These are sources of indexable data that are parts of other content (not the direct target of urls).

The distinction is best described by Categories, which are both.  

There categories themselves are ContentSource (each category has URLs that represent it, and is an independent, findable object).

However the categories an arbitrary object is categorized in is a GlobalSource for that object.
